# Quiz Application with Firebase Integration

## Path System Prompt:
You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS. Follow the Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

## App Description:
You will create a modern quiz application that utilizes Firebase for storage and authentication, allowing users to select subjects, years, and courses, take quizzes with multiple-choice questions, and view their results at the end, simulating a real exam environment. The application will feature a dark theme with a stylish grid dotted background.

## App Flow and Functionality:

1. **User Interface:**
   - The app opens with a homepage featuring a list of available subjects for quizzes, displayed as clickable buttons.

2. **Subject Selection:**
   - When a user clicks on a subject, they are directed to a page where they must select the year (2014 to present) and the course (first or second).

3. **Year and Course Selection:**
   - After selecting a subject, users choose the year and course from dropdown menus or buttons.
   - Once selections are made, users can navigate to the quiz page.

4. **Quiz Taking:**
   - Present a series of multiple-choice questions, one at a time, with clear answer options.
   - Include a timer to simulate a real exam environment.
   - Users can mark questions for review and navigate between questions.

5. **Submission and Results:**
   - Upon completing the quiz, users submit their answers.
   - Display a results page showing the total score, correct answers, user’s answers for comparison, and explanations for each question.

6. **Quiz History:**
   - Users can view their quiz history stored in Firebase Firestore, showing past quizzes taken, scores, and completion dates.

7. **Admin Panel:**
   - An admin interface for managing questions and user access.
   - Admins can add, edit, or delete questions and view a list of registered users.

### Key Features to Implement:

- **Firebase Authentication:**
  - Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication to secure access for students and admins.

- **Cloud Firestore for Data Storage:**
  - Use Firestore to store questions, quiz details, user scores, and quiz history.
  - Organize data into collections for subjects, questions, and users.

- **Dynamic Quiz Loading:**
  - Implement dynamic loading of quizzes based on user-selected subjects, years, and courses from Firestore.

- **Admin Interface:**
  - Create a dedicated admin panel with forms for adding and editing questions in Firestore.
  - Implement validation for input fields.

- **Timer and Navigation:**
  - Include a countdown timer for quizzes and allow navigation between questions.

- **Comprehensive Results Display:**
  - After submission, provide a results page that shows:
    - Total score and percentage.
    - Detailed comparison of the user’s answers versus the correct answers.
    - Feedback on each question.

- **Dark Theme and Stylish Background:**
  - Implement a modern dark theme throughout the application.
  - Use a grid-looking dotted background for a contemporary feel.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually appealing design.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensure robust error handling for quiz loading, question management, and answer submissions.

### Required Components:

Create all necessary components for the quiz application, including but not limited to:

- `subject-list.tsx` for displaying available subjects.
- `year-selector.tsx` for selecting the year.
- `course-selector.tsx` for selecting the course.
- `quiz-selection.tsx` for presenting available quizzes based on selections.
- `quiz.tsx` for displaying questions and answer options, including a timer.
- `result-display.tsx` for showing final scores and comparisons after quiz submission.
- `quiz-history.tsx` for displaying user quiz history.
- `admin-panel.tsx` for managing questions and users.
- `question-form.tsx` for adding/editing questions in the admin interface.
- `error-display.tsx` for handling errors.
- `loading-indicator.tsx` for displaying loading states.

### Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files for exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/subject-list`).
- Favor named exports for components.

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

### Performance Optimization

- Minimize `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with a fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, and implement lazy loading.

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure a user-friendly experience with clear feedback throughout the quiz process.
- Implement security rules in Firestore to restrict admin functions to authenticated users with the admin role.

By following this structure and guidelines, you'll create a modern quiz application that provides an engaging exam-like experience for students while allowing administrators to manage content effectively in Firebase.
